# AsyncIO Error Resolution Summary

## Problem
The entry gate application was experiencing RuntimeError with asyncio event loops when vehicle simulation was triggered, causing the UI to potentially block.

## Root Cause
- Mixed usage of `asyncio.get_event_loop()` (deprecated) and `asyncio.get_running_loop()`
- Improper handling of asyncio contexts in threaded environments
- ALPR processing was trying to create tasks in non-async contexts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Event Loop Detection
**Before:**
```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()  # Deprecated, causes warnings
if loop.is_running():
    asyncio.create_task(...)
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()  # Modern approach
    asyncio.create_task(...)
except RuntimeError:
    # No running loop, use thread
    threading.Thread(target=sync_wrapper).start()
```

### 2. Proper Thread Handling for ALPR
**Before:**
```python
def _start_alpr_processing_sync(self, image_path):
    # Tried to reuse existing loop - caused conflicts
    asyncio.create_task(self.process_alpr_async(image_path))
```

**After:**
```python
def _start_alpr_processing_sync(self):
    # Create completely new event loop for thread
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(self._alpr_processing_thread())
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around all asyncio operations
- Graceful fallbacks when WebSocket server is unavailable
- Automatic audio file creation to prevent missing file errors

### 4. Improved Connection Handling
**Before:**
```python
while self.running:
    if await self.connect_to_server():
        break
    await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Infinite retry loop
```

**After:**
```python
connection_attempts = 3
for attempt in range(connection_attempts):
    if await self.connect_to_server():
        break
    if attempt < connection_attempts - 1:
        await asyncio.sleep(2)

if not self.websocket:
    logger.warning("Running in standalone mode")
```

## Results
- ✅ No more asyncio RuntimeError exceptions
- ✅ UI remains responsive during ALPR processing
- ✅ Entry gate simulation works smoothly
- ✅ Proper separation of async and sync contexts
- ✅ Graceful degradation when server unavailable

## Test Verification
The entry gate now successfully:
1. Starts without errors
2. Connects to WebSocket server
3. Handles vehicle simulation without blocking
4. Processes ALPR in background threads
5. Maintains UI responsiveness

**Command to test:**
```bash
cd e:\DEVS\spartakuler\python
python entry-gate/entry_gate.py
```

The simulation automatically triggers every 10 seconds, demonstrating the stable operation.
